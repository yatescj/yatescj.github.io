Hi, I'm Carolyn and I am not a computer person. 
"Hi Carolyn!" 

Until about three weeks ago, I referred to computer programming and web design as "talking to the computer". TBH, if you had told me you would give me one million dollars if I could name just one programming language, I would have been one million dollars poorer. Or, I guess, just as poor as I am now. [You get it.](http://gph.is/281rBnj) 

My brother-in-law talks to computers in California for a living. I always remember him working at his computer in what I called the "little black box", and typing indiscernible lines and characters and getting responses. "What is going on?! Who is responding to you?" I would ask him. I called it "talking to the computer" and would jokingly ask him how long he had been keeping the person inside the computer hostage for? Obviously there HAD to be someone in there.......he was basically having a conversation with someone in that black box. Maybe he wasn't keeping someone hostage but there had to be someone, somewhere else in the world on their computer responding to him right? Computers don't think! It's a machine with lots of little pieces that go together and then the whole thing plugs into an outlet and then I can send an email, or more importantly, Google my cold symptoms to find out if I am dying or not. 

My journey that brought me to the Full Stack Web Development program started about six months ago. I had been thinking about how little knowledge I had when it came to technology in general and was interested in taking some classes to challenge myself. In my search for courses to take I found the Flatiron School and the scholarship they were offering in partnership with [Birchbox](https://www.birchbox.com/) and figured it wouldn't hurt to apply. I didn't have my hopes up. My computer-related knowledge ended at using task manager to shut down a program that wasn't responding. So fancy right?! To my surprise, I was awarded the scholarship and the rest is [history](http://gph.is/2cn5aE9)! Just kidding, this is [reality](http://gph.is/15zi2NB). I received the scholarship and six short days later I had made the decision to quit my full-time job as a physical therapist and plunge head first into the amazing new opportunity! Now, don't get me wrong, this is some scary sh#t. Don't forget, just a few days ago I was still referring to writing code as "talking to the computer". Heck, I still don't know what to call it. Actually, I recently started referring to it as The Upside Down (if you don't know you [should](http://gph.is/2aMvBjY)) and I think it's catching on! 

I have already started my Full-Stack Web Development program but only part-time as I finish up at my full-time job. Come February 16th I will be fully immersed in it and couldn't be more excited. I am so ready for this challenge and to see what new opportunities arise from this adventure. 

See ya in the Upside Down!
