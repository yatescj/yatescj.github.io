Alright so here I am, about three weeks into the Full Stack program and [full steam ahead](http://gph.is/2bfzLV1)! So far this has been three weeks full of head scratching and wrinkle enhancing brow furrows #botox !! Confusion has far outweighed understanding. But, do not despair my loyal reader, I am not easily discouraged and forward is the only way to go :) 

So, rollercoasters! I used to love them but as I've gotten older (I just celebrated my dirty30.....pour one out for me) I can't really tolerate them; I get too nauseous. Thankfully, I'm just on a METAPHORIC rollercoaster (phew) of [brain functioning](http://gph.is/1ialmD9)! One minute I will be celebrating my supernatural intelligence because my tests passed after only 10 tries and the next minute I'll be resorting to hand-mopping my floors to get my frustration that I can't get my Tic Tac Toe board to put an "X" in position #5 (which is really position #4 of my array but the player doesn't know that but I have to know that and tell my computer to know that......[what?](http://gph.is/2l66Y9y)). 

Despite the rollercoaster, the victories make the utter confusion and dismay all worth it! And by victories I mean I'm granted the ability to move on to the next lab where I can then be completely crushed by my lack of [knowledge](http://gph.is/2cXuXTB). It's all good though. I really am enjoying it! I am currently working my way through the Ruby Development section and, all jokes aside, I feel like I am making progress. Just last night I was actually able to understand what I was telling my husband when he asked how the course was going! I said things like "methods" and "arguments" and "arrays" and told him how I felt like I was getting better at reading the code and (somewhat) understanding what I was supposed to be writing. I was actually able to explain things!!! I've always felt like the best way to really learn something is to teach it to others. I don't think I'll be doing any teaching anytime soon but the fact that I was able to make sentences with Ruby language and actually understand what I was saying is a step in the right direction! 

Thanks for reading! Back to the brow furrowing!
