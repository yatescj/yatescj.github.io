Guys! I just made a tic tac toe board that I can actually PLAY! I'm literally sitting here with a split screen; on one side, I'm writing this very exciting blog post and on the other side, playing tic tac toe against myself! Can it get any better than this?!?!? I'd like to thank the Academy as well as all the Learn.co instructors who helped me along the way.
[I LITERALLY couldn't have done it without you!](http://gph.is/2dJXT22). 

What have I learned along the way? 

Thank you so much for asking! 

Well, I've gone from having absolutely no idea what I was doing and feeling like I was typing completely indiscernable characters into the [little black box](http://carolyn-yates.com/2017/02/14/talking_to_the_computer/) to having a marginal understanding of what I was attempting to accomplish and being able to slightly explain it to people!

Hey, that's a GOOD feeling. 

You know, it's the little things that really add up to a joyful life! Little things like learning how to get to the bottom of the Learn terminal by hitting the up arrow instead of scrolling down for five minutes. Finding the "Toggle Preview" button when writing this blog post so I can actually view what this silly rant will look like before I publish it. Playing a game of Tic Tac Toe THAT I MADE with myself! I'm telling ya, its the little things! 

Anyways, back to what I've learned while creating this miraculous game of Tic Tac Toe! I've learned how to create a method and call arguments to it. I've learned how to create loops so I don't have to write the same thing over and over and over and over again. I'm getting better at reading errors and understanding that error messages are actually my friend and will help me make better code and are not actually [this guy](http://gph.is/1VTuxyK) in code form, put on this earth to make my brain feel like its exploding! I've learned about Nested Arrays and how they can help me keep track of how awesome Beyonce is and all of her show stopping albums and songs in one awesome list! Are you keeping up? It's okay if you're not. I'm a coder now and I know a LOT of technical words and stuff :)  

Oh! I've also learned that Google is going to be my best friend and that I shouldn't be embarassed about asking for help! 

Tic Tac Toe! Who knew it would make me this excited?!

Peace & Love & Code
